# Sample projects

There are two sample projects demonstrating the use of batect:

* [Java](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect-sample-java)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect-sample-ruby)

These also demonstrate how to use batect with Travis CI.

The batect codebase itself also contains [an example of running both Elasticsearch and Kibana](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect/tree/master/tools/log-viewer)
(this is used to view and query log files generated at runtime by batect).

## Other projects using batect

* [weekly-meetups](https://github.com/safiranugroho/weekly-meetups): demonstrates a setup for Clojure and Leiningen
