# Sample projects

There are a number of projects that demonstrate the use of batect:

* [batect-sample-golang](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect-sample-golang): demonstrates a setup for Golang and Circle CI
* [batect-sample-java](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect-sample-java): demonstrates a setup for Java, Gradle, Travis CI and pushing images to Docker Hub
* [batect-sample-ruby](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect-sample-ruby): demonstrates a setup for Ruby and Travis CI
* [weekly-meetups](https://github.com/safiranugroho/weekly-meetups): demonstrates a setup for Clojure and Leiningen

The batect codebase itself also contains [an example of running both Elasticsearch and Kibana](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect/tree/master/tools/log-viewer)
(this is used to view and query log files generated at runtime by batect).
