## The sales pitch

_Build and testing environments as code_

* Consistent, fast, repeatable, isolated builds and test runs everywhere: your computer, your colleagues' computers and on CI
* Manage dependencies for integration and end-to-end testing with ease
* No installation required
* Only dependencies are Bash and Docker (and `curl` or `wget`?)
* Works with your existing CI system
