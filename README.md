## The sales pitch

* Consistent, fast, repeatable, isolated builds and test runs everywhere: your computer, your colleagues' computers and on CI
* Manage dependencies for integration and end-to-end testing with ease
* No installation required, only dependencies are Bash, Docker and `curl`* - onboard new team members in minutes
* Works with any language or framework, your existing CI system, and your chosen language's existing tooling
* Take advantage of existing Docker images to get started quickly

\* at the moment, a JVM is also required, but this requirement will be removed before v1.0
