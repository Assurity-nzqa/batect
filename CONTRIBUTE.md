# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome and thanks for your help.

These guidelines are work in progress. In the meantime here are some
instructions to setup the project so you can start contributing to it.

## Project Setup

### What's required

* JDK (Version 8 or higher)
* Yarn (Version 1.5.1 or higher)
* Git (Version 2.17.0)

### Usage

#### Building the application

`./gradlew build`

#### Running the tests

`./gradlew check`

Or, to run the tests once and then automatically re-run them when the code changes:

`./gradlew --continuous check`
