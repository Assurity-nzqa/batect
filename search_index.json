is batect?\nbatect is a tool that makes setting up, sharing and maintaining Docker-based development and testing environments much, much easier.\nThe main benefits of batect are:\n\nConsistent, fast, repeatable, isolated builds and test runs everywhere: your computer, your colleagues' computers and on CI\nManage dependencies for integration and end-to-end testing with ease\nNo installation required, only dependencies are Bash, Docker and curl* - onboard new team members in minutes\nWorks with any language or framework, your existing CI system, and your chosen language's existing tooling\nTake advantage of existing Docker images to get started quickly\n\n* at the moment, a JVM is also required, but this requirement will be removed before v1.0\nWhat is batect not?\n\na build tool - instead, use your chosen language's existing tooling (eg. Gradle, Rake, CMake or Cargo) from within a batect task\na deployment tool - instead, use your target environment's existing tooling (eg. kubectl) from within a batect task\na CI tool - instead, use your existing CI tool and have it run batect\n\nWhy would you use batect?\nEvery application has a build environment - the tools and configuration needed to take the source code and produce an artifact\nready for use.\nHowever, setting this up can be time consuming and frustrating. Too often new team members' first experience on\na project is a few days working out which tools they need to install, and another few days of then discovering the magic\ncombination of tool versions that will happily coexist. And as the application evolves and changes over time, maintaining and\nupdating this environment across all developers' machines and CI agents can be incredibly painful.\nSimilarly, most applications have external dependencies - for example, other services, databases, caches, credential storage\nsystems... the list is endless. Because of this, we would like to run integration, component or journey tests where the\napplication itself (or some part of it) interacts with these external dependencies.\nIn some cases, we'd like to use a real instance of it (eg. a running Postgres instance), and in other cases, we'd like to use a\nfake (eg. a fake implementation of a downstream service). Either way, installing, configuring and managing all these dependencies\ntakes a lot of work, and making sure they're in a known state before a test run is key to reducing test flakiness. Add in networking\ngremlins, different operating systems, personal preferences, built-up cruft and manual configuration and you end up with an enormous\nnumber of variables that lead to a huge amount of wasted time spent debugging issues that are entirely preventable.\nbatect helps solve these problems by:\n\nallowing you to entirely automate the setup of your build and testing environments\nstoring this automation alongside your application code, so that it is versioned and updated just like any other part of\nyour application\nensuring that every single command invocation starts with a completely fresh environment based on your configuration file,\nmaking it impossible to get out-of-sync from the desired state\nmaking use of Docker to do all of this in an isolated and low-overhead way\nusing some smart dependency management logic, parallelism and Docker's caching features to do all of this very, very quickly\ntaking advantage of Docker's networking features to set up an isolated network for every command\nenabling you to use existing Docker images as-is (or easily use custom Dockerfiles) to quickly get up and running\n\n"},"Comparison.html":{"url":"Comparison.html","title":"Comparison with other tools","keywords":"","body":"Comparison with other tools\nHow does batect compare to...\n...Vagrant?\nVagrant's use of virtual machines means that it is very heavyweight, making it difficult to run multiple projects'\nenvironments at once. This is especially problematic on CI servers where we'd like to run multiple builds in parallel.\nFurthermore, the long-lived nature of virtual machines means that it's very easy for a developer's machine to get out of sync\nwith the desired configuration, and nothing automatically re-provisions the machine when the configuration is changed - a\ndeveloper has to remember to re-run the provisioning step if the configuration changes.\n...using shell scripts to drive Docker?\nWhile it's certainly possible, it quickly gets unwieldy and is difficult to effectively parallelise tasks that can run in parallel.\n...Docker Compose?\nIn the past, I've used Docker Compose to implement the same idea that is at the core of batect. However, using Docker Compose\nfor this purpose has a number of drawbacks.\nIn particular, Docker Compose is geared towards configuring an application and its dependencies and deploying this whole stack\nto something like Docker Swarm. Its CLI is designed with this purpose in mind, making it frustrating to use day-to-day as a development\ntool and necessitating the use of a higher-level script to automate its usage.\nIt also does not elegantly support pulling together a set of containers in different configurations (eg. integration vs journey\ntesting), does each operation serially (instead of parallelising operations where possible) and has\none long-standing bug that makes waiting for containers to report as healthy\ndifficult.\n"},"Installation.html":{"url":"Installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nThe batect script is designed to be committed alongside your project, and not installed globally. It will\nautomatically pull down the correct version of batect for your operating system.\n\nDownload the latest version of batect from the releases page,\nand copy it into your project.\nNote that you only need the file named batect - you don't need to download batect.jar.\n\nMake sure it's executable (run chmod +x batect).\n\nRun ./batect --version and if you see some version information, you're good to go!\n\nNote that a JVM (version 8 or above) must be installed to use batect. (This requirement will be removed in a future release.)\nNow you're ready to configure batect for your project - check out the getting started tutorial, dive into the\nconfiguration file reference, or take a look at one of the sample projects.\n"},"GettingStarted.html":{"url":"GettingStarted.html","title":"Getting started tutorial","keywords":"","body":"Getting started tutorial\nThe samples shown below are taken from the Java sample project.\nInstallation\nBefore you begin, follow the installation steps to setup batect.\nFirst steps: build environment\nTo start, we're going to configure a simple build environment, where you can build your application and run unit\ntests. This example is for a Java project that uses Gradle, and assumes that you already have Gradle set up for your project.\n\nCreate a batect.yml configuration file in the root of your project. For example:\n containers:\n   build-env:\n     image: openjdk:8u141-jdk\n     volumes:\n       - local: .\n         container: /code\n         options: cached\n       - local: .gradle-cache\n         container: /root/.gradle\n         options: cached\n     working_directory: /code\n     environment:\n       - GRADLE_OPTS=-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false\n\n tasks:\n   build:\n     description: Build the application.\n     run:\n       container: build-env\n       command: ./gradlew assembleDist\n\n   unitTest:\n     description: Run the unit tests.\n     run:\n       container: build-env\n       command: ./gradlew test\n\nThere's a bit going on here, so let's break it down:\n\nproject_name: the name of your project.\ncontainers: here we define the different containers that your application needs.\nAt the moment, we just have our one build environment container, build-env.\nWe tell batect which Docker image to use (image).\nWe tell it to mount the project (., the current directory) into the container at /code, and to start\nthe container in that directory (working_directory).\nWe also mount .gradle-cache into the container as /root/.gradle - this allows Gradle to cache\ndependencies between builds, rather than downloading them on every single run. (You probably want to\nadd this directory to your .gitignore.)\nWe use :cached mode for the mounts to improve performance on OS X (see\nthis page for more information). This has no effect on other operating systems.\nWe disable the Gradle daemon, as running\nit is pointless given that we create a new container for every run.\n\n\ntasks: we define our two tasks, one for building the application, and another for running the unit tests.\nThese just run the existing Gradle tasks within the build environment we just defined.\nYou can define whatever tasks you want - common other tasks you might like to add include one that starts a\nshell in the build environment (eg. one with command: bash) and another that automatically runs the unit\ntests whenever the code is changed (eg. command: ./gradlew --continuous test).\n\n\nFor more information on batect.yml, consult the documentation.\n\nRun ./batect --list-tasks, and you'll see the tasks that we just defined:\n Available tasks:\n - build: Build the application.\n - unitTest: Run the unit tests.\n\nRun ./batect build and batect will pull the image used for your build environment, start it and run Gradle within it.\n(Note that this may take a while the first time as the Docker image must be downloaded first.)\n\nSimilarly, if you run ./batect unitTest, batect will start a build environment, run your unit tests within it, and then\nclean up the build environment.\n\n\nThat's it! Your builds and unit tests now run in an isolated and consistent build environment, and you can easily change the\nconfiguration of your build environment without having to install or configure anything manually on every developer or CI machine.\nTaking it further: integration and journey test environments\nSo we've set up an isolated and repeatable build environment. However, where batect really shines is setting up integration and\njourney test environments - environments that require spinning up real (or fake) versions of dependencies such as databases or downstream services.\nLet's imagine our application just has one dependency, a Postgres database. We can define a Docker image for this with a Dockerfile:\nFROM postgres:9.6.2\n\nSave this as dev-infrastructure/database/Dockerfile.\nSo far, so good - this is just like what we had before for the build environment. However, this will start an empty Postgres database,\nand our application probably needs at least a database and a table or two. Create a SQL script called create-structure.sql that creates\nyour database tables and save it in the dev-infrastructure/database folder you just created.\nWe can then take advantage of a feature of the standard Postgres image to have this SQL\nscript run when the container starts. Any .sql file in the /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d directory will automatically be run when\nthe container starts, so if we copy our create-structure.sql script into that directory in the image, then whenever it is started,\nour database structure will be created. So our Dockerfile now looks like:\nFROM postgres:9.6.2\n\nCOPY create-structure.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\n\nThere's one last thing we need to think about though. When Docker starts our database container, all we know is that the container has\nstarted - we have no way to know if the database is actually ready for use. If we want to run tests against our database, we don't want\nto start running those tests until it's actually ready to use. While Postgres is usually pretty fast to start up, it's not instantaneous,\nand other things can take anywhere from a few moments to a minute or two to start up and be ready. We can use\nDocker's health check feature to indicate when a container is ready for use.\nIn our case, we can take the health check script\nfrom the sample project and copy it into our dev-infrastructure/database folder. All it does is try to issue a simple query against the\ndatabase - if that succeeds, we can assume that the database is up and running. (There's\na collection of sample health check scripts provided by Docker you can use.)\nThen we need to tell Docker where to find our health check script, so we need to add it to our Dockerfile:\nFROM postgres:9.6.2\n\nRUN mkdir -p /tools\nCOPY health-check.sh /tools/\nHEALTHCHECK --interval=2s CMD /tools/health-check.sh\n\nCOPY create-structure.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\n\nSo, now we have a Dockerfile that describes how to start up our database, and how to tell when it's ready for use. Now we just need to configure\nbatect to run our tests.\nFirst of all, let's define our database container:\ncontainers:\n\n  ...\n\n  database:\n    build_directory: dev-infrastructure/database\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=international-transfers-service-user\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=TheSuperSecretPassword\n      - POSTGRES_DB=international-transfers-service\n\nThis uses the environment variables defined by the Postgres image to set the username, password and database name to use to connect to it. We\ncould have specified them in the Dockerfile with ENV statements, but this works as well.\nThen we just need to define our integration test task:\ntasks:\n\n  ...\n\n  integrationTest:\n    description: Run the integration tests.\n    run:\n      container: build-env\n      command: ./gradlew integrationTest\n    start:\n      - database\n\nThis is just like the build and unit test tasks we defined before, but we now also specify our database container in start. batect will start\nany containers listed in start and wait for them to become healthy before starting the container given in run.\nUnder the covers, batect will also create an isolated network for all of the task's containers, so that they can communicate with one another\nwithout interfering with anything else on your machine. (They'll still have access to the internet and anything else they could access if they\nwere running directly on your machine though.) This means that the integration tests just need to connect to the host database with the username\ninternational-transfers-service-user and password TheSuperSecretPassword, and Docker will automatically forward that to the database container.\nAnd, after your tests have finished, batect will then remove all the containers it started, leaving your machine in the same state it was before\nyou started.\nSimilarly, if we want to run some journey tests that test our application end-to-end, we just need to create a Dockerfile for our application,\nthen define it in batect.yml:\ncontainers:\n\n  ...\n\n  international-transfers-service:\n    build_directory: dev-infrastructure/international-transfers-service\n    dependencies:\n      - database\n\n...and then add a task:\ntasks:\n\n  ...\n\n  journeyTest:\n    description: Run the journey tests.\n    run:\n      container: build-env\n      command: ./gradlew journeyTest\n    start:\n      - international-transfers-service\n    prerequisites:\n      - build\n\nNote that in this case, we specify that the database container is a dependency of the application container - this means that batect will first\nstart the database container and wait for it to become healthy, then start the application and wait for it to become healthy, and then run the\njourney tests. We also specify that the build task should run before starting the journey tests - this is so that when we start the application,\nwe start the most recent version of it.\nWhere next?\nThere's a comprehensive reference page for the configuration file, and a number of sample applications\nyou can take a look at.\n"},"config/Overview.html":{"url":"config/Overview.html","title":"Overview","keywords":"","body":"Configuration file overview\nbatect uses a YAML-based configuration file.\nBy convention, this file is called batect.yml and is placed in the root of your project (alongside the batect script).\nYou can, however, use a different name or location, and tell batect where to find it with the -f option.\nThe root of the configuration file is made up of:\nproject_name\nThe name of your project.

For example, to set\nSUPER_SECRET_PASSWORD in the container to the value of the MY_PASSWORD variable on the host, use\nSUPER_SECRET_PASSWORD=$MY_PASSWORD. Substitutions in the middle of values is not supported (eg. SUPER_SECRET_PASSWORD=My password is $MY_PASSWORD\nwill not work). Be careful when using this - by relying on the host's environment variables, you are introducing inconsistency to how the container\nruns between hosts, which is something you generally want to avoid.

For example, if a process running in the http-server\ncontainer listens on port 2000, any other container in the task can access that at http-server:2000 without port 2000 being listed in ports (or an EXPOSE\nDockerfile instruction).\nTwo formats are supported:\n\nStandard Docker local:container format.

The health check is still run during this period,\nand if the check succeeds, the container is immediately considered healthy.

This means that any files created by the container will be owned by the user running batect, rather than root.\nThis is really only useful on Linux. On OS X, the Docker daemon runs as the currently logged-in user and so any files created in the container are owned\nby that user, so this is less of an issue. However, for consistency, the same configuration changes are made on both Linux and OS X.\nrun_as_current_user has the following options:\n\nenabled Defaults to false, set to true to enable 'run as current user' mode.\n\nhome_directory Directory to use as home directory for user inside container.

However, while this works perfectly fine for most situations, there is some overhead involved in operations\nthat need to work across the host / virtual machine boundary.\nUsually this overhead is so small that it's not noticeable, but for operations involving mounted volumes, this overhead can\nbe significant. In particular, this can impact compilation operations involving reading and writing many files.\nThere is a way to reduce this overhead significantly: use the\nvolume mount options introduced in Docker 17.04.\nIn particular, for the typical scenario where you are editing code files on your host's disk and mounting that into a container\nfor compilation, using the cached volume mount mode can result in a significant performance improvement - we saw an improvement\nin compilation times of ~60% on one Golang project once we started using this.\n(Before you use these options in another context, you should consult the\ndocumentation to understand the implications of the option.)\nFor example, instead of defining your container like this:\ncontainers:\n  build-env:\n    image: \"ruby:2.4.3\"\n    volumes:\n      - local: .\n        container: /code\n    working_directory: /code\n\nuse this:\ncontainers:\n  build-env:\n    image: \"ruby:2.4.3\"\n    volumes:\n      - local: .\n        container: /code\n        options: cached # This enables 'cached' mode for the /code mount\n    working_directory: /code\n\nSetting this option will not affect Linux hosts, so it's safe to commit and share this in a project where some developers use\nOS X and others use Linux.\nDatabase schema and test data\ntl;dr: try to do as much work as possible at image build time, rather than doing it every time the container starts\n\nA significant amount of time during integration or journey testing with a database can be taken up by preparing the database for\nuse - setting up the schema (usually with some kind of migrations system) and adding the initial test data can take quite some time,\nespecially as the application evolves over time.\nOne way to address this is to bake the schema and test data into the Docker image used for the database, so that this setup cost only\nhas to be paid when building the image or when the setup changes, rather than on every test run. The exact method for doing this will\nvary depending on the database system you're using, but the general steps that would go in your Dockerfile are:\n\nCopy schema and test data scripts into container\nTemporarily start database daemon\nRun schema and data scripts against database instance\nShut down database daemon\n\nShutdown time\ntl;dr: make sure signals such as SIGTERM and SIGKILL are being passed to the main process\n\nIf you notice that post-task cleanup for a container is taking longer than expected, and that container starts the main process from a\nBash script, make sure that signals such as SIGTERM and SIGKILL are being forwarded to the process. (Otherwise Docker will wait 10\nseconds for the application to respond to the signal before just terminating the process.)\nFor example, instead of using:\n/app/my-really-cool-app --do-stuff\n\nuse this:\nexec /app/my-really-cool-app --do-stuff\n\n(source)\n"},"tips/BuildArtifactsOwnedByRoot.html":{"url":"tips/BuildArtifactsOwnedByRoot.html","title":"Build artifacts are owned by root","keywords":"","body":"Build artifacts are owned by root\ntl;dr: if a container produces build artifacts in a mounted volume, enable run_as_current_user, otherwise they'll be owned by the root\nUnix user\n\nOn Linux, by default, the Docker daemon runs as root, and so all containers run as root. This means that when a container writes a file to a mounted volume,\nit is owned by the root Unix user, making it difficult for other users to modify or delete the files. This most often comes up when a build task produces\nan artifact and writes that artifact to a mounted volume.\n(On OS X, the Docker daemon runs as the currently logged-in user and so any files created in mounted volumes are owned by that user, so this is not an issue.)\nTo fix this issue, batect can run containers in 'run as current user' mode, ensuring that all files written to a mounted volume are created by the current\nuser, not root. This mode can be enabled on a per-container basis with the run_as_current_user option.\nWhen enabled, the following configuration changes are made:\n\nThe container is run with the current user's UID and GID (equivalent to passing --user $(id -u):$(id -g) to docker run)\n\nAn empty directory is created in the container at home_directory for the user's home directory.\nWarning: if the directory given by home_directory already exists inside the image for this container, it is overwritten.\n\n\nA new /etc/passwd file is created in the container with two users: root and the current user. The current user's home directory is set to the\nvalue of home_directory. (If batect is running as root, then just root is listed and it takes the home directory provided in home_directory.)\nThis means that any other users defined in the container's image are effectively lost. Under most circumstances, this is not an issue.\n\nSimilarly, a new /etc/group file is created in the container with two groups: root and the current user's primary group (usually staff on\nOS X, and the user's name on Linux). If batect is running as root, then just root is listed.\nAgain, this means that any other groups defined in the container's image are effectively lost. Under most circumstances, this is not an issue.\n\n\nWhile this is really only useful on Linux, for consistency, batect makes the same configuration changes regardless of the host operating system.\nThese configuration changes are harmless on OS X.\n"},"tips/WaitingForDependenciesToBeReady.html":{"url":"tips/WaitingForDependenciesToBeReady.html","title":"Waiting for dependencies to be ready","keywords":"","body":"Waiting for dependencies to be ready\ntl;dr: make sure your image has a health check defined, and batect will take care of the rest\n\nWhen running integration or end-to-end tests, you might need to start a number of external dependencies for your application, such as databases or\nfakes for external services.\nHowever, having these dependencies just running usually isn't sufficient - they also need to be ready to respond to requests. For example, your database of choice\nmight take a few seconds to initialise and start accepting queries, and during this time, any requests to it will fail. So we'd like to avoid starting our tests\nbefore we know these things are ready, otherwise they'll fail unnecessarily.\nbatect supports this exact requirement by taking advantage of Docker's health check feature:\n\nIf a container's image has a health check defined, batect won't start any containers that depend on it until the health check reports that it is healthy.\nIf a container's image does not have a health check defined, it is treated as though it has a health check that immediately reported that it is healthy.\nIf the health check fails to report that the container is healthy before the timeout period expires, batect won't start any other containers and will abort the task.\n\nThere's a collection of sample health check scripts provided by Docker you can use as inspiration, and the\nsample projects use this technique extensively.\n"},"tips/Proxies.html":{"url":"tips/Proxies.html","title":"Proxies","keywords":"","body":"Proxies, Docker and batect\ntl;dr: batect will do its best to make things just work with proxies, with the exception of pulling images\n\nMost applications expect to find proxy configuration in a number of environment variables. The most common are:\n\nhttp_proxy: proxy to use for HTTP requests\nhttps_proxy: proxy to use for HTTPS requests\nftp_proxy: proxy to use for FTP requests\nno_proxy: comma-separated list of domains or addresses for which connections should bypass the proxy (ie.\nbe direct to the destination)\n\nThere are three points where a proxy could be required during the lifecycle of a container:\n\nat image pull time\nat build time, after the image has been pulled\nat run time\n\nEach of these are handled slightly differently by Docker, and so batect does its best to make your life easier.\nAt image pull time\nWhen pulling an image, the Docker daemon uses any proxy-related environment variables in the Docker daemon's\nenvironment to determine whether or not to use a proxy. These settings cannot be set at image pull time, so\nbatect can't handle these settings for you - you must configure them yourself.\nOn OS X, Docker defaults to using your system's proxy settings, and you can change these by going to the Docker icon >\nPreferences > Proxies.\nOn Linux, you may need to configure the Docker daemon's proxy settings yourself.\nThis page in the Docker documentation gives an example of\nhow to configure a Docker daemon running with systemd.\nAt build time, after the image has been pulled\nAfter pulling the base image, all subsequent build steps use the environment variables of the build environment, which is a\ncombination of:\n\nany environment variables defined in the base image with ENV instructions\nany build arguments defined in the Dockerfile with ARG instructions\nany environment variables defined in the Dockerfile with ENV instructions\nany of the pre-defined build arguments, if a value is\nprovided for them\n\nThis last point is the most relevant to proxy settings - as http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy etc. are defined as\npre-defined build arguments, we can pass the host's proxy environment variables into the build environment as build arguments.\nbatect automatically propagates any proxy environment variables configured on the host as build arguments unless the --no-proxy-vars\nflag is passed to batect.\nNote that build arguments are not persisted in the image - they exist only as environment variables at build time. Furthermore,\nthe pre-defined proxy-related build arguments (unlike normal build arguments) do not impact Docker's cache invalidation logic -\nso if an image build succeeded with http_proxy set to http://brokenproxy, changing http_proxy to http://workingproxy will\nnot cause a rebuild.
